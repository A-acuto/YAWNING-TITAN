.. glossary::

..
  How to use:
  - All terms should be added under the subsection that matches the first letter of the term.
  - The term itself should have an indent of four spaces.
  - The term definition should have an indent of sic spaces.
  - When a term definition references itself, the term should be wrapped in bars,
  -    For example, the Sphinx term referencing itself in the definition uses |Sphinx|.
  - When a glossary term is used in text, you can link it to its definition with the :term: role.
  -    For example, to link the term Sphinx to its definition, use :term:`Sphinx`.
  - You can link to a term in the glossary while showing different text in the topic
  -    by including the term in angle brackets. For example, to link the text reStructuredText
  -    to the RST term in the glossary, use :term:`reStructuredText<RST>`.
