# The blue agent does not have to have perfect detection. In these settings you can change how much information blue
# can gain from the red agents actions. There are two different pieces of information blue can get: intrusions and
# attacks.

# --Intrusions--
# An intrusion is when the red agent takes over a node and compromises it. You can change the chance that blue has to
# be able to detect this using the "chance_to_immediately_discover_intrusion". If blue does not detect an intrusion
# then it can use the scan action to try and discover these intrusions with "chance_to_discover_intrusion_on_scan".

# There are also deceptive nodes that blue can place down. These nodes are used as detectors to inform blue when they
# are compromised. They should have a chance to detect of 1 so that they can detect everything (at the very least
# they should have a chance to detect higher than the normal chance to detect) but you can modify it if you so wish
# with "chance_to_immediately_discover_intrusion_deceptive_node" and "chance_to_discover_intrusion_on_scan_deceptive_node"

# --Attacks--
# Attacks are the actual attacks that the red agent does to compromise the nodes. For example you may be able to see
# that node 14 is compromised but using the attack detection, the blue agent may be able to see that it was node 12
# that attacked node 14. You can modify the chance for blue to see attacks that failed, succeeded (and blue was able
# to detect that the node was compromised) and attacks that succeeded and the blue agent did not detect the intrusion.

# Again there are settings to change the likelihood that a deceptive node can detect an attack. While this should
# remain at 1, it is open for you to change.

# --INTRUSIONS--
# -Standard Nodes-
# Chance for blue to discover a node that red has compromised the instant red compromises the node
chance_to_immediately_discover_intrusion: 0.5
# When blue performs the scan action this is the chance that a red intrusion is discovered
